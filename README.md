# uni2grow-digital-invoicing-dash

## Synopsis

As part of a coding interview at Uni2Grow Cameroun SARL, this project builds a React app that peers
with a Spring Boot REST API for the purpose of digital invoicing.

## Guide

```sh
npm install && npm run dev
```

In case you configured the backend API to run on another port than `8092`, you may override the relevant
configuration entry defined in `.env` in your local uncommitted `.env.local` file.
